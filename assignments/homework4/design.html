                <p>Almost all of the websites use repetition of visual elements for organization and display.</p>
                <p>Digital agency network website is one of the effective examples of usage of repetition in web design.</p>
                <p>It uses repetition in multiple ways as listed below.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first repetition can be seen on the top navigation like any other websites today.</li>
                    <li>Then we see a few tiles representing their blog posts with image and some description texts</li>
                    <li>After that there is an Agencies of month section with repeated tiles representing different agencies.</li>
                    <li>As we scroll more, other forms of repetition appears on the page which is fascinating. </li>
                </ol>
