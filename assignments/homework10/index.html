            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            Welcome to our responsive website design assignment! We understand the
            importance of creating a website that looks great and functions well on
            any device, whether it's a desktop computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.

            Our goal with this assignment is to help you develop the skills and knowledge
            you need to create websites that are not only visually appealing, but also easy
            to use and navigate on any screen size. We'll cover topics like user experience
            design, responsive design principles, and best practices for web development.

            As you work on your assignment, you'll have the opportunity to explore different
            design tools and techniques, experiment with different layouts and styles, and get
            feedback from your peers and instructors. By the end of the assignment, you'll have
            a solid understanding of how to create websites that are responsive, accessible, and
            user-friendly.

            We're excited to see what you'll create and look forward to supporting you throughout
            the process. Let's get started!
